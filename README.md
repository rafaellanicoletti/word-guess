# word-guess

I tried doing the entire game from scratch, did some research on other's people code but I basically don't want to be copying someone's code and tailor it to what I am doing since I've been having a hard time understanding Javascript. 
Is not finish because it took me way too long to get it and had to get TA's help. 
working on it though :)
